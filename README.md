*Palindrome Checker*

In the source code, you will be able to find 2 palindrome checker which is:
- PalindromeStringChecker
  - To check if a string is a palindrome
  
- PalindromeIntegerChecker
  - To check if an integer is a palindrome
  
*Note: Both classes come each with a static method called (**isPalindrome**) and since it's static, to use it you need to call specific class before the method
e.g: PalindromeStringChecker.isPalindrome("radar") or PalindromeIntegerChecker.isPalindrome(12321)*
